# Hydrogen Atom Electron Distribution Visualization

This project provides tools to visualize the electron probability distributions of hydrogen atom orbitals based on solutions to the Schr√∂dinger equation. It includes functionalities for generating 2D slices of the 3D probability density and interactive visualizations using Jupyter notebooks.

## Features

- Calculation of electron probability densities for specified quantum states of hydrogen.
- Interactive visualization with a slider to view different slices of the electron distribution.
- Plotting of 2D cross-sections of the 3D electron cloud.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You will also need the following libraries:
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- SciPy
- ipywidgets (for interactive plots in Jupyter notebooks)

You can install these packages using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy ipywidgets
```

If you're using Jupyter Notebook and want interactive plots:

```bash
pip install ipympl
```

### Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gabobaby/quantum_orbital_visualizations.git
```

Navigate to the cloned directory:

```bash
cd hydrogen-atom-visualization
```

### Usage

Run the Jupyter Notebook to interact with the visualization:

```bash
jupyter notebook hydrogen_atom_visualization.ipynb
```

Follow the instructions in the notebook for interactive visualizations.
